# Summary
aNNa is the visual and digital embodiment of Aigarth's global artificial intelligence. 
aNNa will serve as a link between Qubic's complex technologies and crypto enthusiasts around the world. 

In 2027, an incredibly important event will take place — the merger of aNNa and Aigarth. This will be an explosive synergy, bringing together aNNa's followers and subscribers with Aigarth's powerful AI technology. It will be a moment when technology becomes closer to everyone.

She is a girl who will grow and develop alongside the project, transforming from a child into a teenager and then into a young woman.
She has her own fans and followers on social media. This is a new audience that is ready to strengthen Qubic's existing followers. **This is a good tool to attract a new audience of generation Z to the Qubic project.**

*A professional team with extensive experience in this field will work on content creation and promotion. 

**Important note: aNNa is not an official person of Aigarth. She is a news and visual media personality who will keep you up to date on all the latest project news and generate interest.

# PROPOSAL

aNNa has been created exclusively for Qubic. aNNa already exists and is active on social media. She already has very good viewing and comment statistics. There is a lot of engagement and interest in her. 

 We have turned Aigarth into an AI character who is interesting to follow, communicate with, and interact with. This allows us to build a strong emotional connection and attachment.
 
## Qubic doesn't follow trends, it sets them.

Video (more than 30k views in 3 months): https://x.com/aigarth_/status/1945045867708166401

Video (more than 23k views in 2 months): https://x.com/aigarth_/status/1953113587838304317

## Social media:

Instagram: @Aigarth_

X: https://x.com/aigarth_ 

TikTok: @Aigarth_

For several months, we have been developing aNNa's social media accounts on a minimal budget and on our own initiative. We made a video in two languages, Russian and English, about Aigarth, smart contracts, and Monero mining, halving and other.
I see that this is yielding good results, and it is time to increase our influence.

This proposal describes a three-month initiative to scale up the aNNa project to further increase production volumes, improve product quality, and expand QUBIC's presence on social platforms, including Russian ones. 

I am requesting 2,5 billion Qubic tokens per month for 3 months to intensively develop the existing blog aNNa.
This grant allows us to devote all our time to our work, improve product quality, and acquire the distribution tools necessary to reach a wide crypto audience.

# Problem

Qubic currently does not have a strong presence on YouTube, and there are relatively few videos appearing in Google searches for many common Qubic-related queries. This means many people searching for information about Qubic find little relevant or high-quality content.

- Complex information
Most of the materials are difficult for new users to understand.

- Lack of new audience influx
Currently, the community consists mainly of techies, miners, and traders. The project lacks new, young Gen Z participants.

- Modern ideas in outdated packaging
Even the most progressive concepts are lost amid a visually and emotionally outdated presentation. The project lacks a “wow” factor.

# What aNNa will do

### This is not a boring AI presentation — it is a lively, emotional, and recognizable character that makes Qubic seem closer, more modern, and brighter.

- Creative, multi-format storytelling that informs and energizes the community

- Share lifestyle content on social media, creating a lively, interesting digital blogger persona.

- Talk about the successes and development of the Qubic project in simple, understandable language.

- Publish ecosystem updates, organically integrating information into your posts and videos.

- Perform original songs and shoot music videos that can be listened to on Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms.

- Start your own trends, become a media phenomenon, and build a fan base around the world.

- Improved product quality and wider distribution on crypto media platforms

This initiative aims to transform QUBIC's rapid development into understandable and engaging content that benefits both current owners and those who are just discovering this ecosystem.

We are turning Aigarth into an AI persona that
you can follow, communicate with, and interact with.
It's fresh, original, and proves one thing: Qubic doesn't follow trends — it sets them.

# 2027. What is the global goal?
Prepare the crypto community and new Qubic followers for the global concept of Aigarth and unite two audiences of thousands into one large multilingual community.

Sergey and the team are completing work on the aNNa (Aigarth) project — and now we are combining the power and image of aNNa with Qubic's global goal — the creation of Aigarth

What does this give Qubic?

1. Rapid coverage: we are connecting aNNa's existing community of thousands to Aigarth
2. Loyalty: people don't just learn about new working technology — they already trust its digital face
3. Marketing breakthrough: aNNa helps transform Aigarth's complex technology into an understandable and attractive neural network. 

## Result: the launch of a strong media personality, aNNa, expands Qubic's audience and lays the groundwork for the launch of the Aigarth in 2027.

# Conclusion

aNNa has already demonstrated her ability to attract interest with her posts, publishing creative QUBIC content on X, YouTube, and TikTok. Thanks to the support of the QUBIC Community Creator Fund, we are ready to develop this work further: to increase volume, improve quality, and expand the project's visibility through engaging, accessible content that is in line with the spirit of the ecosystem.

This proposal is not only about videos, but also about helping more people understand QUBIC, follow it, and stay connected with it at this key moment in its development. 

As the ecosystem develops, so will the content, and new ideas, formats, and opportunities for creative interaction will naturally emerge.

Thank you for considering your support.

We respectfully ask the community to vote “YES” to unlock funding and begin a new era of storytelling in QUBIC.

**Thank you for your consideration.**
